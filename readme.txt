The Air Polonia web service can be used through the flight aggregators developed by the other members of the group.
In addition, I included the example_requests.txt file which shows examples of requests and responses from the service.
The expired_bookings.py script allows for removal of inactive and expired bookings. 
I also included a 'utils' directory with python scripts I used for testing and populating the database.
